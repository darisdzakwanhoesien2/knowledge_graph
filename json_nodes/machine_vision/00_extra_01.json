    "definition": "Mahalanobis distance is a statistical distance measure that quantifies the separation between a data point and a distribution by accounting for the covariance structure of the features.",
    "description": "It generalizes Euclidean distance by incorporating the inverse covariance matrix, effectively normalizing the feature space according to the data's natural spread and correlations. This makes it robust to scale differences and correlated dimensions, unlike raw Euclidean distance.",
