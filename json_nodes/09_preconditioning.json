    "definition": "Preconditioning is the transformation of a linear system Ax = b into an equivalent system M^{-1}Ax = M^{-1}b (left preconditioning) or AM^{-1}y = b with x = M^{-1}y (right), where M ≈ A is a nonsingular matrix that is inexpensive to invert or solve with, designed to improve the convergence rate of iterative methods.",
